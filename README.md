# Temperature Prediction Using ANN and SVM

[Late Upload]

This repository presents a comparative analysis of **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models for temperature prediction. The study aims to identify which model delivers better performance based on key evaluation metrics including:

* **Accuracy**
* **Computational Time**
* **Goodness-of-Fit Measures**

---

## 📘 Overview

* **Input Features**: Humidity and wind speed
* **Output Variable**: Temperature
* **Preprocessing**: Applied uniformly to the dataset for both models

---

## 🤖 Model Architectures

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

* Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
* Trained using **backpropagation algorithm**

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

* Implemented using **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
* **Coefficient of Determination (R²)**

---

## 🔍 Results Summary

| Model | Accuracy | Computational Time | R² Score |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------ | -------- |
| ANN   | ✅ High   | ❌ Slower           | ✅ High   |
| SVM   | ✅ Good   | ✅ Faster           | ✅ Good   |

* **ANN**: Slightly better in accuracy and goodness-of-fit
* **SVM**: More efficient in terms of computation
